            <p>This project is a collaboration between the Lamongan District Prosecutor's Office and my team (UNAIR). The Lamongan District Prosecutor's Office commissioned the services of my team to conduct analysis and laboratory testing of solar-powered street lights for the purpose of an investigation into a criminal case. The team, consisting of 10 members, conducted inspections and analyses of 1600 units of solar-powered street lights, as well as conducted laboratory tests on the electrical components of the lights. This was done to ensure the conformity of the components with the specified specifications. The project spanned one year from the beginning until the case was closed. The stages involved encompassed checking all units, conducting laboratory testing, and reporting the test results.

            <p>Interning at PT PJB UP Cirata has been an extraordinary experience for me. This is because I passed the internship selection in my 3rd semester, which is relatively early for a university student. The internship was initiated through a collaboration between FTMM and PT. PJB UP Cirata under the MBKM program, Kedaireka. Throughout the internship, I learned many new things, especially in the field of renewable and sustainable energy, solar power generation, operations and maintenance, and power system engineering. At that time, our group from UNAIR consisted of 6 individuals who successfully passed the selection to participate in the internship at PT PJB UP Cirata. Among them, 5 were from the electrical engineering department, while 1 was from the robotics and artificial intelligence engineering department.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Klumutan's Guidance is a digital village map application that was created during my Community Service Program (KKN) in Klumutan Village, Saradan, Madiun. This application was developed in response to the concerns expressed by the Klumutan community. Klumutan Village is a relatively large village, divided into 6 distinct and separate hamlets. For example, if someone from hamlet A is visiting hamlet B and encounters issues like a flat tire, an accident, or needs information about important locations within the hamlet or their current location, this application addresses these challenges. The way this application functions is by providing directions to the required destination. The locations available in the application are added by the previous host, while users can only utilize the services provided within the application.
                <br>Why not use Google Maps? Haha, I'm sure many will ask that question. Well, the answer is that during discussions with several village officials, they requested that the added locations should not be accessible to outsiders. This limitation ensures that the application's scope remains local to Klumutan Village only, in consideration of the village's privacy concerns. Given these issues and requirements, I developed the Klumutan Guidance application within a span of 5 days. I began by integrating the Google Developer Console API key into the Android Studio project, then proceeded to create functions for current location, adding markers, destination locations, obtaining directions, uploading photos, and incorporating features that were deemed necessary for the application.

                I opted for Realtime Database as the storage for latitude and longitude data of the markers on the maps. Meanwhile, photo data is stored in Firebase Cloud Storage. The challenges I encountered during the development of this application primarily revolved around creating a framework and functional logic that had to be clear and precise. This was crucial for the application's proper functioning
                <br>As a result, this application has been launched and handed over to the village authorities for use and further development on July 31, 2023, at the Klumutan Village Hall, Saradan, Madiun.</p>
