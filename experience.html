            <p>This project is a collaboration between the Lamongan District Prosecutor's Office and my team (UNAIR). The Lamongan District Prosecutor's Office commissioned the services of my team to conduct analysis and laboratory testing of solar-powered street lights for the purpose of an investigation into a criminal case. The team, consisting of 10 members, conducted inspections and analyses of 1600 units of solar-powered street lights, as well as conducted laboratory tests on the electrical components of the lights. This was done to ensure the conformity of the components with the specified specifications. The project spanned one year from the beginning until the case was closed. The stages involved encompassed checking all units, conducting laboratory testing, and reporting the test results.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Interning at PT PJB UP Cirata has been an extraordinary experience for me. This is because I passed the internship selection in my 3rd semester, which is relatively early for a university student. The internship was initiated through a collaboration between FTMM and PT. PJB UP Cirata under the MBKM program, Kedaireka. Throughout the internship, I learned many new things, especially in the field of renewable and sustainable energy, solar power generation, operations and maintenance, and power system engineering. At that time, our group from UNAIR consisted of 6 individuals who successfully passed the selection to participate in the internship at PT PJB UP Cirata. Among them, 5 were from the electrical engineering department, while 1 was from the robotics and artificial intelligence engineering department.</p>
