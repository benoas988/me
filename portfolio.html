                        <br>Even though our knowledge was minimal at that time, we remained enthusiastic because we knew that extraordinary results require a challenging process. Since the beginning of this project, we kept on learning and learning to develop our hardware, firmware, and software skills. Our orientation shifted from just being university students to become experts in our concentration. We love discussing our area of expertise anywhere and anytime. This EVCS is a tangible proof of our struggle, and we believe it will lead us to become great engineers in the future.</p>

                    <p>This is our first self-made electric car, at the same time, we became the first team from UNAIR to develop an electric car. We built it from zero with our own hands, utilizing basic tools and materials, as well as the support from UNAIR and FTMM, to develop this electric car. The car was created with the goal of participating in the prestigious event called Shell Eco-Marathon. Our team was very solid and enthusiastic, even though we didn't have much knowledge at that time. We diligently studied until this car was created.
                        <br>The interesting thing is that we started building this car since September 2022, but one month before the competition, we started over. We rebuilt it in less than a month, precisely within just 3 weeks. With determination and lots of coffee, we reconstructed the car. The journey wasn't entirely smooth; as the competition date approached, we faced challenges with our controller, which malfunctioned several times, requiring us to replace components and even rebuild it from scratch. In total, we replaced components 5 times and rebuilt it 4 times, but that's okay. As beginners, we are quite proud of our work.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I would like to express my utmost gratitude to Dr. Agus Mukhlisin S.T., M.T. for what he has taught me, enabling me to develop this controller. This is the first controller I have ever developed. The background of creating this controller is for the Shell-Eco-Marathon and KMHE (Kontes Mobil Hemat Energi) energy-efficient electric car competitions, as well as being the topic of my thesis.

                        The stages of developing this controller began with designing, creating the PCB, assembling, and testing. The journey of developing this controller was not as smooth as imagined; I encountered numerous challenges. Some of these challenges included voltage measurements, component damage, insulation leaks, short circuits in the inverter circuit, and many other issues. I have gone through 3 PCB units, 4 units of STM32F405, 3 sets of voltage meters, 3 sets of MOSFET drivers, 2 sets of PWM Overlapping components, 1 set of current meter, 32 units of MOSFET, 2 units of crystal clocks, and many other components due to system failures.
                        
                        Day by day, I devoted myself to work on this controller. Even after completing the controller, there were still challenges in adjusting and tuning its control parameters. This controller has been used in an energy-efficient electric car competition by the Rasena Team at the Pertamina Mandalika International Circuit.
                        <br>This controller is a programmable controller, allowing users to adjust parameters according to their needs through software. Through this controller, Dr. Agus S.T.,M.T. assisted me in submitting an internal research proposal to the faculty. As a result, the internal research was approved, and I received funding to create my second controller. I will use this controller for the energy-efficient electric car competition and as the main topic of my thesis. That's just 1.5 out of 110 stories behind the creation of this controller.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Klumutan's Guidance is a digital village map application that was created during my Community Service Program (KKN) in Klumutan Village, Saradan, Madiun. This application was developed in response to the concerns expressed by the Klumutan community. Klumutan Village is a relatively large village, divided into 6 distinct and separate hamlets. For example, if someone from hamlet A is visiting hamlet B and encounters issues like a flat tire, an accident, or needs information about important locations within the hamlet or their current location, this application addresses these challenges. The way this application functions is by providing directions to the required destination. The locations available in the application are added by the previous host, while users can only utilize the services provided within the application.
                        <br>Why not use Google Maps? Haha, I'm sure many will ask that question. Well, the answer is that during discussions with several village officials, they requested that the added locations should not be accessible to outsiders. This limitation ensures that the application's scope remains local to Klumutan Village only, in consideration of the village's privacy concerns. Given these issues and requirements, I developed the Klumutan Guidance application within a span of 5 days. I began by integrating the Google Developer Console API key into the Android Studio project, then proceeded to create functions for current location, adding markers, destination locations, obtaining directions, uploading photos, and incorporating features that were deemed necessary for the application.

                        I opted for Realtime Database as the storage for latitude and longitude data of the markers on the maps. Meanwhile, photo data is stored in Firebase Cloud Storage. The challenges I encountered during the development of this application primarily revolved around creating a framework and functional logic that had to be clear and precise. This was crucial for the application's proper functioning
                        <br>As a result, this application has been launched and handed over to the village authorities for use and further development on July 31, 2023, at the Klumutan Village Hall, Saradan, Madiun.</p>
